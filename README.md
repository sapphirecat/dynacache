This project will not be released publicly, in protest of the re-appointment
of Richard Stallman to the board of the Free Software Foundation.

I'm going to need something more than a bunch of white men deciding they miss
their rape apologist buddy, especially if the best they can say about him is
that they "feel his behavior has moderated."  _Does that even mean anything?_
Adding to the apparent insincerity, it took them two weeks to come up with that
egregiously bland statement.

I don't even know what the endgame is, here.  If Stallman were to part ways
again, should I release dynacache?  If there is a release, it's not feasible to
pull it back if they were to reverse course again.  Can I trust the FSF?  Can I
trust Stallman himself?  I don't think I can give a "Yes" to either of those
any more.

RIP the dream.
