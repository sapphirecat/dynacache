# dynacache

A memcached protocol server that stores data to Amazon DynamoDb.

## Private

This project has not been fully released publicly, in protest of the
re-appointment of Richard Stallman to the board of the Free Software Foundation.

## Y tho

Back when I was a teen reading Slashdot, RMS seemed pretty cool.  Since then,
I've grown up, and Stallman hasn't.  I've worked to improve myself, but I have
no power; meanwhile, people with power show very little indication that they
understand improving themselves is _possible,_ or that their actions matter.
Technical people especially seem to think that anything that isn't objectively
quantifiable is beneath their concern.

And if I sit here giving away software, I'm supporting their dream.  I'm
supporting their work.  I'm supporting their public image, implying that yes,
these are people (and organizations) that I want my efforts to be associated
with.  That is no longer the case.

## The future

I will probably release source code eventually; I still believe in the _ideal_
of free software.  If the FSF were to get some true diversity on the board,
enough to escape from tokenism, that day would come sooner.
